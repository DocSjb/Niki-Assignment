# Niki-Assignment
Niki.Ai internship assignment based on Object Oriented Programming. 
The question is present in a pdf file, while comments in the code explains the code and the logic behind it. The code is written in Java and has a Olog(n) complexity.
The other ways to have completed this program was by using Big Integers and by using Brute Force
Big Integers had an issue with efficient handling of long based inputs as that removed the dynamic nature of the code.
Brute force had issues with processing, time complexity and code complexity.
The codes for both these alternative methods, with their constraints in place, will be uploaded in a seperate repository for possible use.
